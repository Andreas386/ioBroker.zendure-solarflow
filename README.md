## Zendure Solarflow adapter for ioBroker

This project is an ioBroker Adapter to read data from the Zendure Solarflow Cloud API. It uses the official API provided by Zendure.
You can read more about the API here: https://github.com/Zendure/developer-device-data-report

Note: Controlling the Output Limit is currently not supported by Zendure, hopefully there will an option to control it in the (near) future.

Note2: You will be logged out of the official iOS or Android App after logging in with the ioBroker adapter. This is a normal behavior, currently I
don't know why. If you have more information, feel free to contact me.

## Donate

If you find the adapter useful for you and want to support my work, feel free to donate by Paypal. Thank You!
(this is an personal Donate link for Nograx, in no relation to the ioBroker Project!)
